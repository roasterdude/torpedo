         <h1>The Cigar Concierge History of Cigars</h1>
        <h4>The afficionado's meeting place for everything cigars. </h4>
         <p>The origins of cigar smoking are still unknown. In Guatemala, 
             a ceramic pot dating back to the tenth century features a Mayan 
             smoking tobacco leaves tied together with a string. Sikar, the term 
             for smoking used by the Maya, may have inspired the name cigar.

        <h4>All premium cigars are hand made.</h4>
    
         <p>
             Boxes of hand-rolled cigars bear the phrase totalmente a mano (totally by hand) 
             or hecho a mano (made by hand). These premium hand-rolled cigars are significantly 
             different from the machine-made cigars sold in packs at drugstores or gas stations. 
             Since the 1990s there has been severe contention between producers and aficionados of 
             premium handmade cigars and cigarette manufacturing companies that create machine-made cigars.

             In 1869, Spanish cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez Ybor moved his Principe de Gales (Prince of Wales) 
             operations from the important cigar manufacturing center of Havana, Cuba to Key West, Florida to escape 
             the turmoil of the Ten Years' War. Other manufacturers followed, and Key West became another important 
             cigar manufacturing center. 
        </p><p>     
             In 1885, Ybor moved again, buying land near the then-small city of Tampa, 
             Florida and building the largest cigar factory in the world at the time[8] in the new company town of 
             Ybor City. Friendly rival and Flor de SÃ¡nchez y Haya owner Ignacio Haya built his own factory nearby 
             in the same year, and many other cigar manufacturers soon followed, especially after an 1886 fire 
             that gutted much of Key West. Thousands of Cuban and Spanish tabaqueros came to the area from 
             Key West, Cuba and New York to produce hundreds of millions of cigars annually. Local output 
             peaked in 1929, when workers in Ybor City and West Tampa rolled over 500,000,000 "clear Havana" 
             cigars, earning the town the nickname "Cigar Capital of the World".
