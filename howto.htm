               Cigar smoking isn’t for everyone. We know that. 
               But we still think every man should know a bit about the art. 
               There’s a lot of history behind this age-old practice as well as an entire culture to go along with it. 
               Plus, you wouldn’t want to seem foolish when one of your friends eventually has a baby and passes out cigars to all of his friends. 
               <em>Would you?</em>

               <li><strong>Hold on there. Before just jumping into cigar smoking, find a nice, mild cigar to start with. </strong>
                   Some cigars may be a bit too strong for beginners and may ultimately ruin the entire experience. 
                   Mild-flavored cigars are also slightly cheaper, which may make it easier to ease into the hobby. 
                   You also won’t have to worry much about lighting an expensive cigar incorrectly or cutting off too much of the cap of an expensive cigar.

               Aging mellows the taste of cigars. Aging may lend complexity to a cigar as the smoke picks up flavor from the cedar found inside humidors, 
               or it may deepen the pure tobacco flavors when cigars are stored in a neutral environment such as in glass, metal or ceramic.

                Unlike smokers who let their cigars burn halfway down before flicking the ashes, I tend to ash often. 
                I've noticed that my cigars often burn unevenly. Could this be related to how often I ash?

                  <li>  <strong>Most of all ENJOY!</strong>
               Again, do not inhale the smoke. Trust us, you won’t like it. Allow the smoke to fill your mouth, taste it and blow it out. 
               Continue to puff and rotate your cigar every once in a while. If you smoke it too fast, your cigar will overheat burn to fast and ruin the flavor. 
               If you smoke it too slow, you’ll have to continually relight it. Flick the ashes once they’re down to an inch or more. 
               You may also want to choose a drink to accompany your cigar. Although we’ll always recommend whiskey – Scotch is the preferred 
               whisky among cigar smokers – coffee drinks, cognac, martinis and Indian Pale Ales pair well with the full flavor of your cigar as well. 
               Once you’ve picked out your preferred cigar, pour your favorite drink and put on some relaxing music. You may find that, health 
               problems aside, cigar smoking can be an extremely tranquil way to pass the time.
